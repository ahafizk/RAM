Radar Based Activity Monitor (RAM):
In this work we developed RAM system based on our paper ["RAM: Radar-based Activity Monitor"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JFZc5jYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=JFZc5jYAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC). System was build using python. Project description is on the paper. Radar signals was collected for various human activities and processed, filtered to finally classify those activities. Extracted features from the signals was fed to the Random Forest classifier to recognize activities.

Dependency of this project:
Scipy, Numpy, python-2.7
