# RAM
Radar Based Activity Monitor
In this work we implement source code based on our paper ["RAM: Radar-based Activity Monitor"](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=JFZc5jYAAAAJ&citation_for_view=JFZc5jYAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC). I developed our code using python. Very simpe project described in the paper. I use Random forest classifier to classify our radar signals. We collect radar signals for diffent human body parts movement in our setting and extract features from it and later on we classify it. 
Dependency of this project:
Scipy, Numpy, python-2.7
